# L4 Efficiency

## Definitions  
Q:  Given a problem, how long does it take to solve it? What is the memory footsprint of the solution?  

for time: average case; a typical problem   
        worst case: the hardest problem
Average case:   
worst case: mathematically the worst case  

## Complexity  
space complexity: LP n variables and m constrains  
nomber of data elements is mn.(non-zero)  

Time complexity:  number of iterations, aritnmetic operations per iteration.  Time per arithmetic operation(HW dependent)  

## Complexity 2  
For simplex method with n variables and m constrains, the uper bound on the number iterations is $ (^{N+M}_m)$  
basic feasible solutions assuming no cycling.  
It is maximized for m=n, hence 

## Cube Analysis  

RMS of contraints  1, 100, 100^2
respresent w   1=b1 << b2<< b3 <<...

adding a fixed value does not change x*
